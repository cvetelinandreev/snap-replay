## The Repeat Block

The `repeat ___` block repeats all actions inside of it, in order, a number of times.

**Example**: *This code will say*: `ABABAB`.

## Modify: Make a Triangle

**Goal**: Modify the current code so that it draws a *triangle* instead of a square:

<div class="quiz">

[Hints](#/triangle-hint)

</div>

v---v
<!-- .slide: id="triangle-hint" -->
## Hints

* You will need to change two blocks' *inputs*, but not the structure of the code.
* After drawing the 3 sides of a triangle, the Sprite should have turned 360 degrees. How much should it turn each time?
